            <h1> Roasted Squash with Lentils, Ricotta and Basil </h1>
            <p> This recipe is fragrant and comforting! I love it best in the fall when it's chilly outside. Most of the cooking happens in the oven, which warms up the house and sends nice aromas that reach me from the couch, while I wait for it!</p>

                <ul>

            </div>

                    <h3> Directions  </h3>

                    <li> Peel and cut the squash into 2 inch chunks. Add to a sheet pan, drizzle olive oil, season with salt and pepper and toss to coat. </li>
                    <li> Roast for 15 minutes </li>
                    <li> Cook lentils according to package. Once they are finished, drain them, add olive oil and lemon zest </li>

                    <li> Lastly, blitz all the ingredients for the basil oil in a food processor. This will be for drizzling on the veggies when served </li>
