            <h1> Roasted Squash with Lentils, ricotta and basil </h1>
            <p> This recipe is fragrant and comforting! I love it best in the fall when it's chilly outside. Most of the cooking happens in the oven, which warms up the house and sends nice aromas that reach me from the couch, while I wait for it!</p>
